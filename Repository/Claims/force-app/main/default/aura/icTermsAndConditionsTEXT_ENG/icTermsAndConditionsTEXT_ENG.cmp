    <p><strong>10.	MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION – CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></p>

                <br />

    <p>
        EVERY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (EACH AN “<strong>ACTION</strong>”) BETWEEN YOU AND IKO (INCLUDING ANY OF IKO’S EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE PROGRAM SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ACTION SOUNDS IN CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY.

        <strong>
            YOU AND IKO AGREE THAT ANY ACTION WILL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND THAT NO CLAIM(S) WILL BE CONSOLIDATED OR AGGREGATED WITH THE CLAIM(S) OF ANY OTHER PERSONS BY CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR OTHERWISE
        </strong>.

        TO ARBITRATE AN ACTION AGAINST IKO, YOU MUST INITIATE THE ARBITRATION, FOR U.S. CLAIMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, TO BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION, AND FOR CANADIAN CLAIMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION ACT, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-43, ALBERTA, AS MAY BE AMENDED) AND YOU MUST COMMENCE THE ARBITRATION AND PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO IKO BY CERTIFIED MAIL AT THE APPLICABLE ADDRESS NOTED ABOVE IN SECTION 9, WITHIN THE APPLICABLE TIME PERIOD PRESCRIBED IMMEDIATELY BELOW. IF YOU PREVAIL ON YOUR CLAIMS IN THE ARBITRATION, IKO WILL REIMBURSE YOU FOR ANY FILING AND ADMINISTRATIVE FEES PAID BY YOU TO THE ARBITRATION ORGANIZATION. Some jurisdictions do not allow mandatory arbitration, so the above arbitration provision may not apply to you in those jurisdictions. An Action may also be referred to another arbitration organization if you and IKO agree in writing. IKO will not elect arbitration for any Action you file in court in which you agree not to seek to recover more than $25,000, including attorneys’ fees and costs, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court. If any portion of this arbitration provision is not enforced in the arbitration, then either you or IKO can file a lawsuit in court to adjudicate the arbitrability of the Action and the enforceability of the portion of the arbitration provision at issue.
    </p>

                <br />

    <p>
        NO ACTION AGAINST IKO RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE PROGRAM SHALL BE BROUGHT LATER THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ARISEN OR ACCRUED. OR SUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IF APPLICABLE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE FOREGOING ONE (1) YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD.
