    CRC RoofPRO™ LOYALTY PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</h1>
<h1 align="center">
    (CRC ADVANTAGE TIER ONLY)
</h1>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The CRC RoofPRO PROGRAM (hereinafter the “<strong>Program</strong>”) is a
    loyalty marketing program owned and operated by Canroof Corporation Inc.
    (hereinafter referred to as “<strong>CRC</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>
”). The Program allows roofing installers (hereinafter “<strong>Contractors</strong>” and individually a “    <strong>Contractor</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”) to benefit from
    special offers and programs designed to enhance your business.
</p>
<p>
    You agree and acknowledge that if CRC accepts you into the Program at the
    Advantage Tier level, these terms and conditions will govern your
    participation in the Program.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>
        THE PROGRAM
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Provided that the Contractor is in compliance with all its obligations
    under the Program, CRC will provide the Program to the Contractor as set
    out below:
</p>
<p>
    a. In accepting this Agreement, the Contractor acknowledges and agrees that
    the Contractor’s rights and obligations under the Program will be in
    accordance with this Agreement, and that the Contractor has read this
    Agreement and understands the terms and conditions set out herein.
</p>
<p>
    b. Current Program Benefits to be provided by CRC to the Contractor at the
    Advantage tier level are as follows: (i) access to the CRC Rewards Elevated
    Promotion (ii) access to the CRC RoofPRO online portal, (iii) CRC
    University educational courses, (iv) Invoice Upload Tool in portal (v)
Profit Power Workshops, (vi) listing on the contractor locator at    <a href="http://www.canroof.com/">www.canroof.com</a>, and (vii) access to
    extended warranties for those Contractors who had access to extended
warranties as of December 2020 (collectively the “    <strong>Program Benefits</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    c. The Contractor acknowledges that CRC intends to introduce additional
    tier levels to the Program in or about the second calendar quarter of 2021
    with differing qualification requirements and benefits. At such time, a
    revised Agreement setting out the terms and conditions of the multi-tier
    program will be provided for acceptance by Contractors who wish to remain
    in the Program. The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that CRC Advantage
    members who do not meet the qualification requirements for such higher
    tiers will have certain of their Program Benefits reduced, including losing
access to extended warranties and removal from the contractor locator at    <a href="http://www.canroof.com/">www.canroof.com</a>, and right to promote
    themselves as a RoofPRO.
</p>
<p>
    d. The Program Benefits have no monetary value whatsoever and cannot be the
    basis of a monetary claim against CRC. Program Benefits are limited to the
    Contractor while a member of the Program and are nontransferable.
</p>
<p>
    e. CRC may from time to time, in its sole discretion, add or remove, or
    change the operational rules or criteria for, the Program Benefits, and in
    the case of removal of any Program Benefits or a change in their
    operational rules or criteria, upon prior notice to the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    f. In addition to the rights set out above, CRC specifically reserves the
    right, from time to time, in its discretion, to unilaterally amend the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement. Amendment to the terms and
    conditions of this Agreement and the Guide, which are wholly within CRC’s
    control, will be made upon prior notice to the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    g. CRC assumes no liability to Contractors whatsoever by reason of the
    amendment to the Program, in whole or in part, the addition and deletion of
    Program Benefits, or any changes to this Agreement made in accordance with
    this Section 1.
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    h. CRC reserves the right to withdraw or terminate the Program on prior
    notice to the Contractors. In such event, CRC will issue a prorated refund
    of any membership fee paid, if any.
</p>
<p>
    i. CRC’s performance and provision of the Program and Program Benefits
    shall be excused by events which are outside the reasonable control of CRC,
    (“<strong>Force Majeure Events</strong>”), which shall include, but not be
    limited to, interruptions in service of any Program Benefit as a result of
    a Force Majeure Event, including, without limitation, interruptions in
    service of the IT platforms on which the Program is run.
</p>

    guidelines and standards, and in accordance with all applicable building
    codes and rules and regulations applicable to the Contractor’s business.

    of the Contractor Obligations may result in the termination of the

    reason, or in the event that the Program itself is withdrawn or terminated,

    represent itself to the public as a member of the CRC RoofPRO Program and
    will immediately discontinue the use of any CRC RoofPRO-branded literature

    exclusive owner of CRC and CRC logo trademarks, as well as trademarks
    associated with CRC products, and undertakes not to contest or challenge
    the validity and use by CRC of such trademarks or other intellectual
    property owned by CRC. Save as set out herein, no license or right is

</p>
<p>
    b. Upon the introduction of the multi-tier program, the Contractor will be
    provided an opportunity to advance to a higher tier if the Contractor so
    qualifies, or the Contractor may remain at the Advantage tier, and the
    Initial Term will be extended until December 31, 2021, upon completion of
    all registration requirements and payment of the applicable membership fee,
    which will be prorated based on the date of registration. Failure to pay
    the membership fee within the established time limits may result in
    suspension of the Contractor’s membership and benefits or in the
    termination of the Contractor’s membership.
</p>
<p>
    c. The Contractor may terminate its membership in the Program at any time
    and for any reason by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice to

    will cease as of the termination date.

    or the Program.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
</h1>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    THE PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM BENEFITS PROVIDED THEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED “AS
    IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” CRC MAKES NO GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS OR
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY LAW OR OTHERWISE,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONTENT, QUALITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS,
    EFFECTIVENESS, RELIABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, USEFULNESS,
    USE OR RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE PROGRAM AND PROGRAM BENEFITS,
    INCLUDING WARRANTIES AS TO UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICE,

    (INCLUDING ITS LICENSEES, ASSIGNEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND
    THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, AND THE RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
    SHAREHOLDERS AND REPRESENTATIVES) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE CONTRACTOR IN
    RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND OR ACTION, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NATURE OF THE
    CAUSE OF THE CLAIM, DEMAND OR ACTION, ALLEGING ANY LOSS, INJURY OR DAMAGES,
    DIRECT OR INDIRECT, WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OR POSSESSION OF THE
    PROGRAM AND PROGRAM BENEFITS, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, CONTRACTS
    OR SAVINGS, OR ANY OTHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE CONTRACTOR’S USE OF OR INABILITY

    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>8. </strong>
    <strong>MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION — CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>
</p>
<p>
EVERY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (EACH AN “    <strong>ACTION</strong>”) BETWEEN YOU AND CRC (INCLUDING ANY OF CRC’S
    EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE PROGRAM SHALL BE
    RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ACTION
    SOUNDS IN CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE
    THEORY.
    <strong>
        YOU AND CRC AGREE THAT ANY ACTION WILL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL
        BASIS AND THAT NO CLAIM(S) WILL BE CONSOLIDATED OR AGGREGATED WITH THE
        CLAIM(S) OF ANY OTHER PERSONS BY CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, IN A
        REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR OTHERWISE.
    </strong>
    TO ARBITRATE AN ACTION AGAINST CRC, YOU MUST INITIATE THE ARBITRATION, IN
    ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION ACT (ONTARIO), AS MAY BE AMENDED, AND YOU
    MUST COMMENCE THE ARBITRATION AND PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO CRC BY
    CERTIFIED MAIL AT THE ADDRESS NOTED IN SECTION 9, WITHIN THE APPLICABLE
    TIME PERIOD PRESCRIBED IMMEDIATELY BELOW. IF YOU PREVAIL ON YOUR CLAIMS IN
    THE ARBITRATION, CRC WILL REIMBURSE YOU FOR ANY FILING AND ADMINISTRATIVE
    FEES PAID BY YOU TO THE ARBITRATION ORGANIZATION. Some jurisdictions do not
    allow mandatory arbitration, so the above arbitration provision may not
    apply to you in those jurisdictions. An Action may also be referred to
    another arbitration organization if you and CRC agree in writing. CRC will
    not elect arbitration for any Action you file in court in which you agree
    not to seek to recover more than $25,000, including attorneys’ fees and
    costs, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.
    If any portion of this arbitration provision is not enforced in the
    arbitration, then either you or CRC can file a lawsuit in court to
    adjudicate the arbitrability of the Action and the enforceability of the
    portion of the arbitration provision at issue.
</p>
<p>
    NO ACTION AGAINST CRC RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE PROGRAM SHALL BE
    BROUGHT LATER THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ARISEN OR
    ACCRUED, OR SUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IF APPLICABLE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW FOR
    THE FOREGOING ONE (1) YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD.
</p>
